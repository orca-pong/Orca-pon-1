* 🤝 How I Learned Org Mode — Thanks to a Friend

My journey with Org Mode didn’t begin with deep understanding—it started with curiosity.

I first saw Org Mode on my friend’s laptop. He told me about it and tried to explain the benefits, but I didn’t fully understand. Later, I was inspired by him and gave it another try—this time on my phone using *Termux*.

That's when I discovered *Emacs*.  
And everything began to change.

He:
- Guided me step by step  
- Helped me set up Emacs on mobile  
- Taught me how to use GitHub inside Termux  
- Gave me time, support, and belief in my ability

Thanks to him, I now feel confident using tools that once seemed too complex.

I didn’t just learn software—I learned:
- Focus
- Patience
- Self-discipline

I am deeply grateful to him.  
Sometimes, all it takes is one person to believe in you.  
And for me, that person was my friend.

* 🙏 Thank You
